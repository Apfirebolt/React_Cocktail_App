# Cocktails - Cocktail Database App in React

## Project Briefing

This is a cocktail database app created in React Js powered by bootstrap css framework. This app using data from the CocktailDb website and contains details about loads of cocktails across the globe. Please support them, in my knowledge it's one of the easiest APIs to use with no authentication. 

Using this app you would be able to search through the cocktail collection by name, you'd be able to filter them by whether they're alcoholic or not, filter by ingredients and more.
